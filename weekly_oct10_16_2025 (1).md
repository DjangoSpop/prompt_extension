The fatality rate has increased by **100%** with **2 deaths** recorded compared to 0 in the previous week. The security situation in Kuajok, including the whole of Warrap State, remains relatively calm but unpredictable due to ongoing revenge killings and inter-communal cattle raids.

Cross-border incursions from Lakes State and Unity State, combined with intra-communal revenge attacks, remain the main reasons for most crime incidents in the state.

## **KUAJOK: Crimes with Full Narratives**

### 1. **CATTLE RAID IN TONJ EAST (RETALIATORY)**

On 9–10 October 2025, armed youths from the Jalwau community in Wunlit Payam carried out retaliatory raids against the Luanyjang and Thiik communities in Rum-Athian village, Palieng Payam. The raids were reported as revenge attacks following earlier cattle thefts by Luanyjang youths, who reportedly raided Jalwau livestock twice prior, causing the loss of 75 cows. During the attacks, the Jalwau youths targeted multiple cattle camps, seizing approximately 500 cattle from Thiik and other Luanyjang camps. In addition, a juvenile boy from the Luanyjang community, who was attending to cattle during the attack, was abducted but later released unharmed. The raiders tied down boys in some kraals to prevent interference during the raids. Despite repeated interventions by county authorities, security advisors, and traditional leaders, the stolen livestock have not yet been recovered, and the raiding youths remain mobile and armed. No casualties were reported during these incidents; however, the security situation is highly tense, with fears of escalating retaliatory attacks between the Jalwau, Luanyjang, and Thiik communities.

On the night of 12–13 October, traders transporting cattle in Tonj East County, between Malual-Cuum, Ngap-agok, Danga, Romic, Adanga, and Ramathieng areas, were attacked in two related incidents. In the first incident, around 2:00 AM, two traders were seriously beaten while transporting over 50 herds of cattle and fled for safety; the unknown raiders were suspected to be from the Thiik and Jalwau communities. Twenty to twenty-six cattle were stolen, and the incident was reported to local authorities, including the County Commissioner. Traders threatened to establish checkpoints near Thiet if the stolen cattle are not returned. In the second related incident, 84 cattle stolen from Ramathieng cattle camp (mostly Luanyjang-owned) were mistakenly taken by youth from the Jalwau community of Wunlit Payam.
