# CRIME ANALYSIS/INTELLIGENCE OFFICE/ FOCAL POINT

## Monthly CRIME ANALYSIS REPORT

### SEPTEMBER 2025

**KUAJOK FIELD OFFICE:**

**SUMMARY OF REPORT: MONTHLY**

---

## Abstract:

During the month under review -- September 2025, a total of **(34) cases** were reported, which is a decrease of **33.3%** compared to **(51) cases** that was reported in the month of August 2025. (Sources: NPS, FIOC, and IDSR).

## Reason for change in statistics as compared to previous period:

In the month of September 2025, UNMISS Kuajok FO has recorded **(34)** number of cases which is a **decrease of 33.3%** compared to the cases recorded in the previous month. Despite the overall decrease in total incidents, there was a concerning **increase of 250% in murder cases** (from 0 in August to 10 in September) and **significant fatality rates** with **16 deaths** recorded during the month. The inter-intra-communal conflict and revenge killings continue to be primary drivers of violence, particularly affecting border communities with Unity State. Cross-border cattle raids by armed groups from Unity State targeting Warrap State communities have intensified, contributing to the elevated murder rates.

## Recommendation

UNMISS priorities are to focus on engaging in activities to deter violence and protect civilians in their communities by projecting an outward presence in Warrap State; monitor, investigate and report on human rights violations; encourage free movement of the civilian population, support dialogue and consultations between communities in conflict to reduce tensions and promote intra and inter communal reconciliation. The Field Office therefore recommended and undertook the following activities in different Payams and Counties; Workshops **00**, ISDP/SDP -- **(00)** ILDP/ - **(04)** IDAP - **(02)**

UNPOL is in coordination with different Counties, Payams and Boma authorities so that crime cases are followed up in areas of their jurisdictions, as engagements and different activities have also continued eg visitations, workshops, meetings with county commissioners, chiefs, women groups, youths, and senior police officers of NPS. Frequent ILDPs and ISDP to the most affected areas to show the UN presence, have also continued to observe security situation, coordination with the county authorities, youth leaders and community chiefs to settle issues peacefully and to assure the people of peace and security. Enhanced coordination with Unity State authorities is critical to address cross-border violence. The FO has recommended that close monitoring of all activities in the state should continue with particular focus on border security.

## Feedback

The feedback remains positive as the community and the Police continue working toward lasting peace solutions. Meeting attendance with UNPOL and the community remains encouraging. The NPS are very welcoming to UNMISS programs and ready to work collaboratively in supporting peaceful activities. The community now works closely with the NPS, with feedback indicating increased information sharing from PCRC groups, making investigations easier and enabling proactive policing. Women groups, youths, and elders participate actively in meetings and workshops, demonstrating their commitment to peace and knowledge sharing. However, concerns about cross-border security and cattle raids remain challenging issues requiring sustained attention and coordination with neighboring state authorities.

## Details of Crime Statistics:

**Murder 10, Rape 06, Cattle Raid 07, Shooting Incident 05, Suicide 01, Kidnapping 01, Arson 01, Assault 01, Abduction 01, Escape from Custody 01**

This month the FO has recorded: **(227) cattle raided, and (103) cattle were recovered.**

### **Regarding GBV/SGBV cases increase/decrease this month compared to last month:**

**GBV/SGBV Cases: This month (6) cases were recorded, representing a 40% decrease compared to last month's (10) cases.**
